# Django-Template
A Python Django Application to get started quickly

## Setup
The application assumes you will have a main or core piece of the application
the default name for that is main but you can of course change it to whatever you want. 
Just be sure to change it in the settings and app files 


To start the docker container with the application you only need 1 command


```
docker compose up --build
```

## Things you may consider replacing

<ul>
<li>The name of the root django project is called "DjangoTemplate". You would need to change it in settings.py file as well</li>
<li>The container name for the app is called djangoTemplate. You may want to change that as well</li>
<li>The first django "app" is main if you want to change that you'll need to change it in settings</li>
</ul>
